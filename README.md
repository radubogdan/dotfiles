web-vim-config
========

This is my personal Vim configuration. It's not the best vim configuration out there, it's made according to my preferences.

There are 2 versions of this, the __normal__ one has more plugins and it's going to load a little bit slow. The __light__ one is faster and has fewer plugins.

Feel free to fork, pull request or distribute it.

### Structure and Installation

This config uses [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) plugin management system to organize vim directory.
Vundle also updates all of your plugins. I chose this over Pathogen because it works great with git and Github.

The main file, where all the customizations occur is ```.vimrc``` and in the second file ```.vimrc.bundles``` are all the plugins that I use.

After you choose a version, you can install it:

__Normal:__

```bash
curl http://dotix.me/install.pl -o install.pl && perl install.pl normal
```

__Light:__

```bash
curl http://dotix.me/install.pl -o install.pl && perl install.pl lite
```

### Great Plugins!

I can't cover all of the plugins in this section. If you already know what you need, just edit
the .vimrc.bundles file. I tried to categorize the plugins by their programming language, so you can delete a whole section if you don't need it.

Surround.vim is all about "surroundings": parentheses, brackets, quotes, XML tags, and more. The plugin provides mappings to easily delete, change and add such surroundings in pairs.

```ysiw"``` - ```word``` to ```"word"```.

```cs"'```  - replace ```"``` with ```'```

```ds"``` - remove ```"``` from ```"word"```
